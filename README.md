**This project is in alpha. Expect :bug: and :fire:**
 
* Wlosh is yet another Unsplash client. I made this for my own use and as an excuse to learn Kotlin.
If you find any mistake, then either create an issue or send a Pull Reqest.

## FAQ
#### Q: Why do we have to specify the access key, there are other apps which don't ask for key ?
#### A: Providing key is extra task for user but Unsplash updated their privacy policy, so new apps cannot ship with keys for apps that use Unsplash as an wallpaper app.
